-> Ballsort level 7 is solved with PPO from SB3 (1M total steps)
    Reward = 1 for legal actions
    Reward = 0 for ilegal actions
    Reward for solving a tube = 50
    Reward for winning game = 300
    Reward for terminal state = -300
    Reward for episode length limit = -1
    Max steps = 3000

    -> Problem: Giving reward for legal actions correlates with solving tubes and correlates with solving the level...
    Will this hold for more complex levels?

    -> Level 7 is solved with just rewarding the agent for solving tubes, he learns to not take ilegal actions :)
